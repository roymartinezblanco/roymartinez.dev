My name is Roy Martinez, I’m a photography enthusiast but in business hours I am a Computer Science analyst. Over the last couple of years, I’ve been focused on Cloud and Content Delivery Networks for TOP Fortune 500 companies within Akamai’s Consulting Services but I’m very well versed in Cloud (GCP, AWS), DevOps and the flavor of the month of when you read this.

I am used to working under pressure and in a multinational environment where my proactive and fast learning competencies are vital to ensure the work is done with the best quality possible and that I don’t die in process :).

If you found me a little interesting checkout my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roymartinezblanco/) or my [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/roymartinezblanco/) to see me get better at photography.
